# FloodPredict-ML

A machine learning-based system to predict flood occurrences using historical weather and environmental data.

---

## Overview
This project predicts flood risks using machine learning models trained on datasets containing rainfall, temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors. The goal is to assist in disaster management and early warning systems.

---

## Features
- Predicts flood risks using ML algorithms.
- Supports visualization of predictions.
- Modular and easy-to-use codebase.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical weather and environmental data:
- Rainfall (mm)
- Temperature (Â°C)
- Humidity (%)
- River water levels (m)

use the provided dataset: [https://github.com/Vamsikrishna81068/FloodPredict-ML/blob/main/Flood%20Predict-ML/Code/demo.csv](#).
